The Amazon Clone project is a web-based endeavor that replicates the familiar and user-friendly interface of the Amazon website. Developed using HTML and CSS, this project showcases the ability to recreate key features of the renowned online retail platform, including navigation, search functionality, product categories, and responsive design. It serves as both a learning experience and a visual representation of an e-commerce website, allowing users to explore and interact with the familiar elements of Amazon. While currently focused on the front-end, the project has the potential for future enhancements, such as implementing shopping cart functionality and user account management.
